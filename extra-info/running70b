What an interesting question!

Yes, it is possible to download the Llama3.1:70b manifest onto a USB 
drive, rent a Linux cloud server with at least 32.3 GiB of RAM, and pipe 
input and output into it to run the version remotely, even if your local 
system doesn't have enough memory.

Here's a step-by-step outline of how you can achieve this:

**Step 1: Download the Llama3.1:70b manifest onto a USB drive**

* Make sure you have a USB drive with sufficient storage capacity (at 
least 16-32 GiB, depending on the size of the manifest).
* You'll need to download the Llama3.1:70b manifest from the Hugging Face 
model hub or another source.
* Save the downloaded manifest file onto the USB drive.

**Step 2: Rent a Linux cloud server with at least 32.3 GiB of RAM**

* Choose a cloud provider like Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean.
* Select a suitable instance type that meets your requirements:
	+ CPU: At least 1-2 vCPUs (depending on the task's computational intensi
intensity).
	+ Memory: At least 32.3 GiB of RAM (to accommodate the Llama model and o
other processes).
	+ Storage: Make sure the instance has enough storage capacity to hold the 
manifest file.
* Create a new instance with the chosen configuration.

**Step 3: Configure the Linux cloud server**

* SSH into your newly created instance (you can use PuTTY on Windows or 
the built-in terminal on macOS/Linux).
* Update the system and install necessary packages:
	+ `sudo apt-get update` (or equivalent for other distributions)
	+ Install Python, pip, and any other dependencies required by the Llama 
model
* Make sure to have a suitable version of Python installed (e.g., Python 
3.8 or later).

**Step 4: Mount the USB drive on the Linux cloud server**

* Connect the USB drive to your cloud instance's virtual machine.
* Identify the device name using `lsblk` or `fdisk -l`.
* Create a mount point and mount the USB drive:
	+ `sudo mkdir /mnt/usb`
	+ `sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb`

**Step 5: Transfer the Llama manifest file to the Linux cloud server**

* Copy the downloaded manifest file from the USB drive onto the Linux 
cloud server using SSH commands (e.g., `scp`, `rsync`).
* Alternatively, you can transfer files between instances within a cloud 
provider.

**Step 6: Pipe input and output into the Llama model running on the Linux 
cloud server**

* Use tools like `socat` or `netcat` to establish a connection between 
your local system (or another remote instance) and the Linux cloud server.
* Run the Llama model on the cloud server using the manifest file as an 
argument, piping input/output from/to your local system:
	+ `python -m transformers.Llama3.run --manifest /mnt/usb/lama_manifest.j
/mnt/usb/lama_manifest.json ...`

Please note that you'll need to adapt this outline according to your 
specific requirements and environment.

Some potential considerations:

* Make sure you have sufficient bandwidth for transferring the manifest 
file between your systems.
* Be mindful of any rate limits or usage policies within cloud providers.
* If you're not familiar with Linux commands, consider seeking help from a 
colleague or searching online resources.

Good luck!
