When running the Llama model for the first time using the `transformers` 
library, the manifest file (`lama_manifest.json`) is expected to be in the 
same directory as the script running the model.

However, since you plan to run the model on a Linux cloud server with the 
manifest file located on an external USB drive, you'll need to specify the 
full path to the manifest file when running the model.

If you're using the `transformers` library's built-in functionality to 
load the Llama model, you can pass the path to the manifest file as an 
argument:

```python
from transformers import Llama3

manifest_path = "/mnt/usb/lama_manifest.json"
model = Llama3.from_pretrained(manifest_path)
```

In this example, replace `"/mnt/usb/lama_manifest.json"` with the actual 
path where your manifest file is located on the external USB drive.

If you're not using the `from_pretrained` method and instead want to load 
the model from scratch (i.e., without using the `transformers` library's 
caching mechanism), you can specify the manifest file path when running 
the Llama model:

```python
import os

manifest_path = "/mnt/usb/lama_manifest.json"
model_dir = "/tmp/lama_model"

if not os.path.exists(model_dir):
    os.makedirs(model_dir)

# Run the Llama model using the manifest file
os.system(f"transformers-Llama3 run --manifest {manifest_path} 
--output_dir {model_dir}")
```

In this case, make sure to replace `"/tmp/lama_model"` with a suitable 
directory where you want to store the model's temporary data.

Keep in mind that the external USB drive needs to be mounted on the Linux 
cloud server before running the Llama model. If the USB drive is not 
properly mounted, you'll need to adjust your script accordingly or explore 
alternative methods for storing and accessing the manifest file.
